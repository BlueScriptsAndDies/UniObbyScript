# UniObbyScript

this should work with a decent amount of obby games.

# How does it work?

it checks for a 'Checkpoints' or 'Stages' folder and checks to see if the children are baseparts or models

# Supported but not then Not Supported?

this is because it will also to check if the parts inside of the folder are numbers or Checkpoint01/Stage01, if not it changes it to not supported.
